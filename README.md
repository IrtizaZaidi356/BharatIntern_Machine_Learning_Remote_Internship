### **Project No# 01: House Price Prediction:**

#### **Introduction:**
 - The House Price Prediction project (Project No# 01) aims to develop a machine learning model using Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow for predicting house prices. The primary objective is to create a robust model capable of providing accurate price estimates based on various features like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other relevant factors. This project is part of a remote internship with Bharat Intern, focusing on practical applications of machine learning in real-world scenarios.

#### Understanding Objectives:
 #### 1) **Data Exploration and Cleaning:**
   - The project begins with importing essential libraries and loading the house price prediction dataset. The dataset, sourced from 'Housing.csv,' contains information on various features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc. Object columns are converted to numeric using Label Encoding to make them compatible with machine learning algorithms.

 #### 2) **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Extensive exploratory data analysis is conducted to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable (price). The project utilizes various visualizations such as bar charts, box plots, pair plots, correlation matrices, histograms, scatter plots, pie charts, bubble charts, and area plots to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics.

 #### 3) **Model Training:**
  - The machine learning models are trained using scikit-learn and TensorFlow. A linear regression model from scikit-learn is employed for its simplicity and interpretability. Additionally, a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras is developed to capture complex patterns in the data. The training process involves splitting the data into training and testing sets, feature scaling, and model fitting.

 #### 4) **Streamlit App:**
  - To enhance user interaction, a Streamlit web app is created. Users can input details such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and other features to obtain house price predictions. The app seamlessly integrates the trained scikit-learn and TensorFlow models, providing users with predictions in real-time.

#### **Methodologies:**
  - The project follows a structured approach, starting with data exploration and cleaning, moving to EDA, and culminating in model training and application development. The utilization of both traditional machine learning (scikit-learn) and deep learning (TensorFlow) showcases a comprehensive approach to solving the regression problem.

#### **Outcomes:**
  - **Data Understanding:** The EDA section reveals key insights into the dataset, highlighting relationships and patterns that contribute to house prices.
  - **Model Performance:** The scikit-learn Linear Regression model and TensorFlow neural network are trained to accurately predict house prices. Evaluation metrics such as mean squared error are used to assess model performance.
  - **Streamlit App:** The Streamlit web app provides a user-friendly interface for predicting house prices based on user input. It enhances accessibility and usability, showcasing the practical application of the developed models.

#### **Conclusion:**
  - The House Price Prediction project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning in predicting real estate prices. The combination of scikit-learn and TensorFlow allows for a well-rounded approach, considering both traditional and deep learning methodologies. The Streamlit app further extends the project's impact by making the models accessible to a broader audience. Through this project, a foundation is laid for understanding, implementing, and deploying machine learning models in real-world scenarios, contributing to the broader field of data science and artificial intelligence.
